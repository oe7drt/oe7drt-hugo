# my personal website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6658b217-9b6e-4eb8-b450-655ba0563f53/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/oe7drt/deploys)

This is my personal website. It is a simple and minimalistic website.

The code of this website is saved on Github. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
publishes that code with help from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - which is the
static site generator I use on my websites nowadays.
