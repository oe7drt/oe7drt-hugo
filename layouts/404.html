      	may not be accessible right now, but I'll do my best to get them
      	back online and make some redirects if necessary.</p>
      	<p>You may still browse my old content on the following resources:</p>
      	<ol>
      		<li><a href="https://dominicreich-old.netlify.com/">my first, old website made with jekyll</a> - this website would be <strong>searchable</strong> with algolia search</li>
      		<li><a href="https://dominicreich.com/">the same website, but made with hugo</a></li>
      	</ol>
