Hi there, you just scanned one of my NFC tags.

{{< nfccounter >}}

This is a special page on my website for people that scan my NFC tags.

Browse along the [Blog](/blog/) or [pick a tag](/tags/) if you like to browse
throughout the content.

[Visit the search](/search/) if you're looking for something special.

This website is maintained by me, Dominic Reich, OE7DRT.

For an older version with some software programmed with Visual Basic 6.0
[visit my very-old version][old-version] of
`dominicreich.com`.

[old-version]: https://dominicreich-old.netlify.app/portfolio/software/

The old version is written in german and the software can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/freefallcid?tab=repositories&language=visual+basic).
