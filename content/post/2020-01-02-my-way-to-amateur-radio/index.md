I'm not the casual ham radio operator that always wanted to operate his own
ham radio station. I tried CB once but had to travel quite a bit to reach other
stations (trucks on the highway for example). I've played with SDR before and
tried a few things with GNUradio and gqrx but I never got deeper into this kind
of things.

Just to be clear on this: This is not a tutorial, this is a short story from
my life that explains how I came to my amateur radio license. This article was
already published in german on my older website -

In 2019 I decided to go on a [preparatory course](https://oe7.oevsv.at/veranstaltungen/veranstaltungen-00001/Amateurfunkkurs-in-Innsbruck/)
at my local ham radio club.

A confirmation email was sent to me but the docs for the course had to be changed
because changes have been made to austrian laws regarding ham radio and
telecommunication in general. So scripts were not up to date at that moment.

## General information

The course was held in a room in a federal higher technical institute in
Innsbruck. I had to drive around 70km (\~1h).

We had to attend these blocks:

1. block
  - Friday, September 27, (15:00 to 20:30) - *introduction and law pt 1*
  - Saturday, September 28, (09:00 to 18:00) - *law pt 2 and engineering pt 1*
2. block
  - Friday, October 4, (15:00 to 20:30) - *operating technology pt 1*
  - Saturday, October 5, (09:00 to 18:00) - *engineering pt 2*
3. block
  - Friday, October 11, (15:00 to 20:30) - *engineering pt 3*
  - Saturday, October 12, (09:00 to 18:00) - *engineering pt 4 and operating technology pt 2*
4. block - refreshing
  - Saturday, October 19, (13:00 to 17:00) - *simulation of an exam (it was
    highly recommended to visit this training)*

## Cost report

This represents the total amount of money I had to put into getting my license.

|                 | **549.89 €** | **total**                |

In the end I paid **203.60€** for gasoline, **27€** for lunch on Saturdays and
**110.60€** for parking my car.  
At this time I drove a BMW M140i which needed around 9 liters gas per 100
kilometers---you may get away with less on that part.

## The exam

The exam is split into three different topics: law, engineering and operating
technology.

Every person gets three questions in *law*, three questions in *engineering* and
three questions in *operating technology*. This happens one person at a time, so
if person 1 answered the first three questions person 2 has to answer three
other questions in the same topic.

We had to leave the room for a while when our examiners discussed our results.
When we entered the room again we were told if we get a license or not :-)

All attendees have passed the exam and got their license. We were 15 people.

## Future plans

Most of us have already requested their callsign. A workshop about different
transeivers and antennas is planned for November 23 in Innsbruck from 09:00 to
18:00. At 19:00 a graduation party is planned at the restaurant Deck 47 in
Innsbruck.

I joined the local ham radio club "ÖVSV" and I am a member of ADL714.

### Slowly

My shack is a work in progress. I own a few devices that allow me to setup a
small station on short wave and soon on the digital sector within the DMR
Austria network (IPSC2).
