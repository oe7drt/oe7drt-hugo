## Specifications

## My two cents

The D878UV+ was the first digital radio that I bought.

The usage of the supplied CPS is good, although I never managed to download
recordings off the radio. Whenever I go to {{< badge >}}Tools --> Record
{{< /badge >}} the CPS kills itself with this message:

> Run-time error '339':
>
> Component 'MSCCOMCT2.OCX' or one of its dependencies not
> correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid

I haven't found any solution so far; I rarely boot into the Windows environment.

I like the loud speaker of the handheld and the digital monitor is a great
addition to the digital radios I guess -- and if you switch to the correct
channel when transmitting it is also not much of a problem.

The modulation of the radio is good.
