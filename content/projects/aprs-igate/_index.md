## APRS iGate

*Sorry, this page is a quick-setup page, that means I quickly wrote it to get
published on the i-net for you.*

### What the I-Gate does

At the moment: nothing special. I use it for testing, the antenna is in
the house behind the window and shutter. If you read this, you probably
found the link on an APRS website like `aprs.fi` or `aprsdirect.com`.

### Testing

As of today, August 2nd 2020 testing has begun and the I-Gate will pick up
packets from within the house and some meters outside. I'll publish more data
when I have collected more information.
